## Description:
---------------

NPC mod for Baldur's Gate 2 (BG2), Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT), Baldur's Gate 2 : Enhanced Edition (BG2EE) and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET) :

(For BG2 Throne of Bhaal must be included)

Nikita is a WeiDU-based mod for Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal. This mod adds a new encounter, new items, dialogs between Nikita and fellow NPCs and the player's character. As usual, Nikita should be compatible with most other WeiDu-based mods, and should be installed after all official patches and preferably the Baldurdash Fixpack or G3's Fixpack. Nikita requires the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. This mod uses files and effects that ToB has. (Originally included in Enhanced Edition). 

Nikita already appeared in the [DarkHorizons mod](https://github.com/11jo/DarkHorizons) for BG1. (She is recrutable in BGEE only) 

## Install:
-----------

Extract archive contents into your game directory

    Double click SETUP-NikitaRedux.exe and follow the instructions.

Though this mod is made using the WeiDU standard, and *should* be compatible with all other WeiDU-based mods, there is always the possibility for conflicts. We suggest you install this mod AFTER the official patches. If you encounter any problems installing the mod, please our forums. 

Install this mod **AFTER** EET

Install this mod **AFTER** BGT

## Compatibility :
------------------

Nikita should be compatible with most Weidu mods, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. This version works with Baldur's Gate 2, Baldur's Gate Trilogy, Baldur's Gate 2 : Enhanced Edition and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy.

## FAQS :
--------

Q: What do I need to use this MOD?
A: For BG2 vanilla Nikita requires Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal with the latest Bioware/Interplay patches. We also strongly encourage the installation of the Baldurdash Fixpack or some other BG2 fix pack as well.

Q: Are there any new quests?
A: None.

Q: Will Nikita take part in the Throne of Bhaal expansion?
A: She can be used in ToB but she has no dialogs for banters and interjections at the moment, if ever.
